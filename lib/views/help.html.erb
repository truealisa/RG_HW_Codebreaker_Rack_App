        <p>Codebreaker is a logic game where you will have to break a secret code generated by your computer. Secret code is a four-digit number where each digit is in the range from 1 to 6. You have 10 turns to guess. Each turn you have to input four digits and system will return you up to four '+' and '-' signs. A '+' indicates an exact match: one of the digits in the guess is the same as one of the digits in the secret code and in the same position. A '-' indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.<br><br>

        Good luck!</p>
